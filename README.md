Media Upload and Streaming System

Developed a YouTube-like media platform using Next.js, Node.js, and AWS S3 for video uploading, streaming, and playback.
Integrated S3 for storing media content and implemented services to upload and stream videos using presigned URLs.
Built a custom file upload service that supports chunked uploads to AWS S3 for large media files, enabling efficient video uploading.
Created a streaming functionality using react-player, enabling users to stream both YouTube videos and uploaded content from S3.
Implemented OAuth 2.0 with Google Sign-In for secure user authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can upload content.
Designed and implemented a Kafka-based architecture to handle real-time video transcoding, where videos are uploaded in chunks and processed asynchronously.
Utilized Prisma ORM for managing video metadata in PostgreSQL, ensuring robust and scalable database operations for tracking uploaded content.
Familiar with HLS streaming protocols and dynamic media conversion for adaptive video streaming.
